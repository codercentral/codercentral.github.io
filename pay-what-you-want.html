    <div class="row" style="margin:5% 0 1% 0;">
        <h1 class="text-center" style="margin-bottom:2%">Why Pay What You Want?</h1>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>1) It's always affordable</h3>
            <p>Our mission at Coder Central is to inspire students of all backgrounds to think beyond
                the traditional classroom to create something truly meaningful. We want every student
                to have the opportunity to participate in our classes regardless of any financial restrictions.
            </p>
            <h3>2) It allows you (parents) to hold us (teachers) accountable</h3>
            <p>
                With this model, you as parents get to hold us directly accountable for how we teach and work with your students.
                At any point you don't think we are responsive to your questions or meeting your students needs, you can reflect this
                at the end of the class when you pay us.
                <br><br>
                However, we will always give individual attention to each student before, during, and after class to improve
                their learning experience by adjusting to their learning style and interests.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3>3) Always leave satisfied</h3>
            <p>
                Regardless of your opinion of the quality of the course, you will be able to reflect this opinion in your
                payment. This way you will not have to overpay for something you did not see the value in.
                <br><br>
                With that said, we do put a lot of effort into creating our curriculum and projects as well as training
                our teaching assistants. While the curriculum does have students leave the class with certain products,
                it is designed to emphasize more on the journey of learning to create the products.
            </p>
            <h3>4) Focus on the experience</h3>
            <p>
                With this model, you and your student can focus more on working with us to create a better experience for
                them instead of spending that time unsatisfied with the quality of the program.
                <br><br>
                In our classes, we make each student the center of their learning experience which includes us (teachers),
                you (parents), peers, and mentors. This model allows us to better focus on creating this environment.

                    As we mentioned at the beginning of the course, we are allowing you to pay us what you believe is
                    fair value of the course based on your own experience and your student’s experience as well as
                    comparable programs around the area (refer to syllabus for range).

                    student and preparing for the classes.</b> We’ve spent 75 hours in class at Oracle and Google Hangouts,
                    and apart from these sessions we have also spent time individually working with each group to help
                    them with their ideas. Out of class we spent a lot of time preparing and improving our curriculum,
                    and spent a month recruiting and training our 5 teaching assistants.

                    Our objective for this program is for your student to leave with:

                    <ol>
                        <li>A team they can work with</li>
                        <li>A startup idea that they can pursue after the course</li>

                        <li>The passion and ability to learn technical skills to make their ideas into reality</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    If he or she wishes to continue to work with us, we always need help and would be happy to give them an internship position with us!
