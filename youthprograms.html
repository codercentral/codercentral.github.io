            What matters more when you're applying for a job: a 4.0 GPA or previous work experience. Now more than ever,
            companies care more about what you do outside of the classroom rather than inside the classroom. At Coder Central,
            we offer internship opportunities for middle and high school students in marketing, web design, and content development.
            All of these internships place emphasis on providing real world working experience to inspire students to think beyond the classroom
            as well as helping them in applying for a job. If you're interested in just coding, we are also planning on creating
            Hack Clubs and Competition Programming Clubs in the near future so stay tuned! Also, if you have any questions regarding these
            programs, please let us know at info@codercentral.org.
