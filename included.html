            At Coder Central, our course does not just include lessons with our instructors, but also many other activities
            and resources as well to help our students learn, inspire, and create. Take a look below to see all the the

                    <p class="text-muted">After every class, we provide problems and challenges for
                    students to practice and apply skills they learned in class. Written by Coder Central
                        instructors and content creation team, our challenge sets include both review problems and harder challenges that
                        push and develop students' problem solving and critical thinking skills. Solutions including a
                        written guide and video walkthroughs are provided after the set is due the following class.

                    <p class="text-muted">For each topic, reference sheets to online guides and forums are provided
                    to students to review and reinforce the material covered in class. Through these reference sheets,
                        students gain self sufficiency and become a more independent coder. This is a skill we heavily
                    emphasize because with coding standards changing on a monthly basis, it is cruicial that students have
                        the skills to keep up with them even after the class.

                    <p class="text-muted">We also place heavy emphasis on teamwork and collaboration in our courses because
                        this is a skill that coders must have to be able to work in the industry. To
                        reflect this, we hold an online discussion session between classes for students. These are moderated by an
                        instructor or teaching assistant. During this time, students work together to learn and review
                        concepts covered in class and in the homework, and teach each other on how to work through the harder problems.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Throughout our courses, students build several projects to apply their
                    knowledge and create something fun, practical, and ultimately that shows how coding can solve real world
                        problems. Our instructors create and release interactive
                    videos to help students get started and guide them through the first steps of the project.</p>
