            At Coder Central, our courses does not just include lessons with our instructors, but also many other activities
            and resources as well to help our students learn, inspire, and create. We strive to create an environment
            the replicates how professionals collaboratively learn on the job. We also heavily emphasize practical
            application of the skills we teach so students are given internship opportunities at Coder Central with our
            Content Development Team and Web Services Team.
            Take a look below to see all the the other things that are included when you sign up for one of our classes.

                    <p class="text-muted">After every class, we provide problems and challenges for
                    students to practice and apply skills they learned in class. Written by Coder Central
                        instructors and content creation team, our challenge sets include both review problems and harder challenges that
                        push and develop students' problem solving and critical thinking skills. Solutions including a
                        written guide and video walkthroughs are provided after the set is due the following class.

                    <p class="text-muted">For each topic, reference sheets to online guides and forums are provided
                    to students to review and reinforce the material covered in class. Through these reference sheets,
                        students gain self sufficiency and become a more independent coder. This is a skill we heavily
                    emphasize because with coding standards changing on a monthly basis, it is cruicial that students have
                        the skills to keep up with them even after the class.

                    <p class="text-muted">We also place heavy emphasis on teamwork and collaboration in our courses because
                        this is a skill that coders must have to be able to work in the industry. To
                        reflect this, we hold an online discussion session between classes for students. These are moderated by an
                        instructor or teaching assistant. During this time, students work together to learn and review
                        concepts covered in class and in the homework, and teach each other on how to work through the harder problems.</p>

                    knowledge and create something fun, practical, and ultimately that shows how coding can solve real world
                        problems. Our instructors create and release interactive
                    videos to help students get started and guide them through the first steps of the project.</p>

        <p class="col-md-6">What matters more when you're applying for a job: a 4.0 GPA or previous work experience. Now more than ever,
            companies care more about what you do outside of the classroom rather than inside the classroom. At Coder Central,
            we offer internship opportunities for middle and high school students in marketing, web design, and content development.
            <strong>In fact, Surya, one of our instructor, was a former student of Daniel when he ran ACE Coding</strong>!
            </p>
        <p class="col-md-6">
            All of these internships place emphasis on providing real world working experience to inspire students to think beyond the classroom
            as well as helping them in applying for a job. If you're interested in just coding, we are also planning on creating
            Hack Clubs and Competition Programming Clubs in the near future so stay tuned! Also, if you have any questions regarding these
            programs, please let us know at info@codercentral.org.</p>

                <p>What does it take to be a productive member of today's economy?
                    A college degree? A master's degree? Or perhaps an excellent GPA
                    from high school and college? The reality is, it takes more than
                    just a prestigious degree or a stellar GPA. More than ever now,
                    companies are looking for creative people with a drive to solve
                    problems- qualities that are not taught in school.</p>

                <p>If anything, what we see in school today is doing the exact opposite.
                    Students are conditioned to fear failure as it comes with associated
                    punishments such as a bad grade or peer judgement. This not only
                    discourages students to continue to try, but also destroys their creative
                    potentials.</p>
                <p>Creativity is born from mistakes and learning from them. At Coder Central,
                    courses are revolved around reviving the innate creativity and curiosity
                    that people are born with. Small class sizes ensures that students receive
                    personalized attention and for them to feel like they are in a safe environment.
                    Teachers at Coder Central place a heavy emphasis on teaching student because they want to learn
                    as opposed to telling them what they should learn. </p>
                <p>Curriculums are designed with the intention of challenging students and fostering
                    their ability and motivation to learn on their own. This is something that we believe
                    is far more valuable than just telling students what they should know. </p>
