            <p>From my own education experience in k-12 school (which really wasn't that long ago for me, haha),
                I eventually found school to be something that's artificial and an extremely toxic environment
                to be truly creative. It was so toxic that I fell into depression at the beginning of senior
                year in high school.
            </p>

            <p>It wasn't until I started my own club in high school that was able to excite hundreds of
                kids across the Bay Area as well as work with Microsoft to realize that learning is so
                much more than just tests. </p>

            <p>After reading articles about <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Why-are-Palo-Alto-s-kids-killing-themselves-6270854.php"
                    target="_blank">teens suicide</a> in the Bay Area due to academic pressures,
                I realized that my own school district isn't that different. All of the testing as well
                as peer, family, and teacher pressure to perform was placing an excruciatingly heavy
                burden upon all of us.
            </p>
            <p>This was when I knew I had to do something about reviving kids' innate sense of curiosity to
                become the next business, political, and social leaders of tomorrow. More specifically Asian Americans.
            </p>

            <p>So often in the news do you hear media talk about how Asian Americans are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2015/10/16/the-effects-of-seeing-asian-americans-as-a-model-minority/model-minority-seems-like-a-compliment-but-it-does-great-harm"
                    target="_blank">"the model minority,"</a>
                and they're doing better than any other ethnicity. However, just how many Asian American politicians
                , actors, or business leaders have you heard of? Definitely not as many as it could be.
            </p>

            <p>My eventual goal is to open up more classes for Coder Central so that we have several classes
                the form a small business completely run by students. We would include business, marketing,
                coding, graphics design, product design, research and development classes, and more that
                would all contribute to the same business run by students.
            </p>
            <p>
            The marketing class would help the business class; the graphics design class would work closely with the coding and marketing classes; the product design class would work closely with the business and coding classes; etc. In creating such an environment, I hope to help students see their place in a very complex business world.
            </p>
            <p>
                But even beyond this, I hope to help restore their self esteems as learners, because for too long have we been evaluating a student's worth based off of his or her test scores which punishes mistakes and rewards the right answers.
            </p>
            <p>
            What testing as done to students is that it has conditioned students to fear failing - which is the most important ingredient that is required to produce innovators. Innovators come from people having an understanding of various topics and fearlessly integrating one field with another, even in the face of failures, to create something truly unique.
            </p>

            <p>
            This is what I want Coder Central to become. I want it to become a place where kids learn to embrace failure, and to realize and see that using what they have learned, they have the potential to solve real world problems. This is what I believe it will take to produce the next generation of innovators.
