				<p>This is a question that we at <a href="http://codercentral.org/homepage.html" target = "_blank">Coder Central</a> get asked a lot. Most parents tend
				to question whether their child will be able to learn computer science at [insert age here],
				especially if their child is in elementary school. This blog post won’t give an explicit age
				for when to start programming because each child is different. It will, however, give a 
				general idea of when I believe is the correct time to learn.</p>
				
				<p>At Coder Central’s free Code Camp over the summer, we had students ranging from 3rd 
				graders to seniors in high school. Now that’s a diverse classroom! We had kids who were
				taking calculus to people who had never even heard of algebra. With such a class setting,
				there was enthusiasm across the whole age spectrum. </p>
				
				<p>Now what do you need to start programming? Not much. Simple arithmetic—addition, subtraction,
				multiplication, and division—that is about it. This means that with interest, even elementary
				school students can start building their first program! </p>
				
				<p>Many of our Code Camp students didn’t have any experience in programming coming in. However
				, they were able to pick up the vocabulary and a few concepts that are important to programmers.
				This means that by learning in a class or online, you or your child will learn the necessary tools 
				and knowledge that allow computer scientists to solve problems. </p>
				
				<p>So how does this play a role in someone’s development? When a child learns how to apply logic at
				an early age to solve problems, they’re already ahead of the game. And to help with this, we are 
				seeing more and more online resources and applications nowadays that are trying to teach young kids
				<a href = "http://mashable.com/2014/02/19/robot-turtles-board-game/#e6xCrtRe08qj" target = "_blank">(even as young as 3 years old!)</a> how to program. </p>
				
				<p>With the digital age at large, parents are exposing their children to programming early on, and kids and adults are learning on their own for their own interest.
				This goes to show that <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/parents/learning/view/why-kids-should-learn-to-code-and-how-to-get-them-started" target="_blank">planting 
				these seeds early</a>
				kids and adults are learning on their own for their own interest. This goes to show that  will make programming easier for them as they grow up and help them understand 
				basic programming logic that will be invaluable to many.</p>
				
				<p>Before you start, there has to be something that clicks—a feeling of comfort that won’t make you
				shy away from learning something new. If your environment or method of learning isn’t something that
				you can connect with, then you won’t be able to truly begin. That is why younger kids (6-10) should 
				focus on learning the logic behind a program through block-based programming or through a <a href="http://codercentral.org/register.html" target="_blank">class</a> that
				teaches the concepts in a simple and applicable way. It has to be cool, fun, and interactive, otherwise
				there’s neither curiosity nor inspiration.</p>
				
				<p>The earlier people learn, the more we can cover up the stereotypes that come with being a programmer.
				They won’t have a mentality where computer scientists are introverts who don’t have lives, but instead 
				are heroes who can bring great change to their community or world. Perhaps with this new perspective, 
				girls will express more interest in this budding field. The earlier age you start learning, the more 
				informed you will be of how technology is combined with other fields.</p>
				
				<p>With all that said, the answer to the question is simple. Start now instead of later. There isn’t 
				a specific age when people should start learning how to program, but learning earlier on doesn’t hurt,
				only helps!</p>
